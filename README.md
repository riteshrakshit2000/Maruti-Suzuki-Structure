#<Maruti Suzuki Database Project>#

 This is a database system I built to handle operations for a car dealership network (specifically modeled after Maruti Suzuki). It covers the whole flow—from customers buying cars to tracking inventory and handling service records.

Here is what is inside the files:

1. dbms.sql
This is the main file. It is the SQL script that builds the whole database. It creates the database named "maruti_suzuki_db" and sets up all the tables like Customers, Vehicles, Orders, and Employees.

I also included some sample data in there (INSERT statements) so when you run it, the tables won't be empty. You will see dummy data for things like car models, a few customers, and service records just to show how it works.

2. structure.pdf
This is basically the documentation or reference sheet. If you don't want to read the code directly, you can look at this PDF to see the table structures, column names, and how everything connects.

How to run it:
You just need a SQL tool like MySQL Workbench. Download the SQL file, open it up, and run the script. It should create the database and fill it with data automatically.

What it handles:
- Keeping track of customers and what they bought
- Managing stock of cars and spare parts
- Handling sales orders and payments
- Tracking vehicle service history and warranties
- Managing dealerships and employee info
